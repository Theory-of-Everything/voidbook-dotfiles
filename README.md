# VoidBook dotfiles
## (dont skip if you want to "attempt" to use these dots)

This repository has 2 locations [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/Theory_of_Everything/voidbook-dotfiles) and [Github](https://github.com/Theory-of-Everything/voidbook-dotfiles)
I don't really check one or the other more frequently, so choose what you like.
(Also bear with me if I suck at source control)

These are the dotfiles for my laptop.

This is a heavy work in progress, as I am not the most proficeint linux user.
Feel free to open any issues if you see something off or incorrect.
